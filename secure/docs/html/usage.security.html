>			Even though phpSecureSite is designed to take care of as much as possible
			of the security of a web-application it is not magic pixie dust that will
			make your application impregnable. Misconfigurations, poor infrastructure
			security, bad code and other factors can make all the security provided
			by phpSecureSite useless. Here are a few tips for making your application
			secure.
		</P

>				Run your application over SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or TLS (Transport
				Layedr Security). SSL and TLS encrypts the data which is sent
				back and forth between the client and the web server. If you don't
				encrypt the data, it can easily be picked up from the network and
				people can get access to session data and even sensitive data which
				may be transmitted. Most web-servers today come with SSL and/or TLS,
				ask your sysadmin for info. Also, to avoid session hijacking, check out the
				<A
HREF="modules.normal.html#MODULES.NORMAL.HIJACK"
><I
>hijack (session hijacking countermeasures)</I
></A
>
				module.
			</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>				Escape special characters in data which you place in SQL queries.
				If you don't, then crackers can put special characters in form data
				etc which will manipulate your SQL queries. If you use the same
				database for phpSecureSite and your application (see the
				<A
HREF="usage.database.html"
><I
>Accessing the database</I
></A
>
				section) then you can use the <A
HREF="ref.html#REF.FUNC.DB_ESCAPE_STRING"
><TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>phpss_db_escape_string()</TT
></A
>
				function.
			</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>				Urge your users to use secure passwords. Many users have extremely
				simple passwords (such as "password", "12345678" or "sex"), these can
				be easily guessed by crackers to gain access to an account. Random
				combinations of capital letters, small letters and numbers, with
				eight or more characters, are best. Also see the
				<A
HREF="modules.normal.html#MODULES.NORMAL.BRUTEFORCE"
><I
>bruteforce (bruteforce attack protection)</I
></A
>
				module.
			</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>				Only give information to people who should have access to it.
				When someone requests a specific data item you should make sure
				that the user making the request is the owner of the data
				(for example for viewing customer receipts in a web-store).
				You can use the <A
HREF="modules.normal.html#MODULES.NORMAL.ACL"
><I
>acl (access control lists)</I
></A
>
				module to restrict access to a page to specific users.
			</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>				Turn off the register_globals setting for PHP. If it is enabled,
				crackers can make your application do unexpected things by setting
				script variables through GET variables etc.
			</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>				Make sure your network infrastructure is secure. Use firewalls
				and other security devices, and only give access to services
				which needs to be accessed (don't leave your database server open
				for the whole Internet, for example). A good policy is "that which
				is not explicitly allowed, is denied".
			</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>				Keep your software up-to-date. Most projects and vendors have mailing
				lists which notify you of important upgrades and security problems in
				the software - make sure you are on them.
