>				User accounts are created by adding entries to the table <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>phpss_account</TT
>.
				This table has four columns; id, username, password and active. The id
				is an auto-incrementing column, so you won't need to set anything here. This
				is just a unique identifier for the account used internally by phpSecureSite.
				Username is, as the name implies, the username of the account, password
				is the account password, and active sets whether or not the account is active
				(allowed to be used). You normally won't need to set anything for the active column
				as it defaults to active.
			</P
><P
>				The password column is a bit special. phpSecureSite will expect passwords to
				be stored in a specific format - see the <A
HREF="config.options.html#CONFIG.OPTIONS.AUTH"
><I
>Authentication options</I
></A
>
				for info on configuring it. If you plan on having functionality such as mailing
				passwords to users who have forgotten it you must store the password in plaintext
				format, as encrypted passwords can only be retreived by already knowing the password
				(they use themselves as an encryption key).
			</P
><P
>				If you would like to create an account with a plaintext password you would
				run a query such as this:

>				Accounts could have been deleted simply by removing their entry from the account
				table, but usually you really don't want to do this. Deleting accounts means
				that all sessions, log entries and other data that is bound against the account
				no longer have an owner, and in effect loses some of their usefulness. So instead
				of deleting an account it is better to simply deactivate it. This is easily done by
				setting the account.active field to 0. If you, at a later time, would like
				to re-active the account you just set this field to 1.
