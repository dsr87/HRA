	* core: removed the PHPSS_LOG_DEBUG log class

	* database/*: made group names case-sensitive, and raised max length

	length

	* database/mysql: made all varchar columns binary (case-sensitive)

	strings

	* module/database/*: query handlers now checks if a valid database
	link is available before executing query

	* modules/auth/database: explicitly checks that the username and
	password of the found account matches the user input

	* modules/auth/mysql,pgsql: rework of query result generation

	* modules/auth/mysql,pgsql: mysql_escape_string() and
	pg_escape_string() used instead of addslashes()

	* modules/log/database: phpss_db_escape_quotes() used instead of
	addslashes()

	* modules/log/file: rewrote module to store fp when opened, and
	use it whenever it is needed - this way, the fp is opened only once
	per request

	* modules/log/syslog: now calls define_syslog_variables() during
	PHPSS_EVENT_SYSTEM_INIT

	* global: code cleanups

2003-07-19  Erik Grinaker <erikg@wired-networks.net>

	phpss_module_set_config_value(), phpss_module_get_data_value() and
	phpss_module_set_data_value(), and made phpss_module_get_data() and
	phpss_module_set_data() operate on the whole module data set

2003-07-18  Erik Grinaker <erikg@wired-networks.net>

	core system

	* core: renamed phpss_check() to phpss_validate()

	database modules must keep track of database link themselves

	* modules/auth/mysql,pgsql: database links are stored in the modules
	data registry, and a link is opened only once and on demand

	* core, modules/database/*: added the PHPSS_HANDLER_DB_CLOSE handler,

	phpss_db_escape_quotes(), used for escaping potentially harmful
	characters in user-inputted data

	* core, modules/auth/*: if magic_quotes_gpc is turned on, all escapes
	are stripped in phpss_authenticate(). Escaping is done again in the
	authentication module, as various backends have different ways of
	escaping.

2003-07-15  Erik Grinaker <erikg@wired-networks.net>

	* core: created phpss_module_get_reg_struct(), which returns
	the module structure in the registry. This is used for all data
	and config related module functions, which gets a unified interface
	for any kind of module.

	* core: removed phpss_module_get_data_reference(), as references can
	be returned by phpss_module_get_data()

2003-07-13  Erik Grinaker <erikg@wired-networks.net>

	PHPSS_HANDLER_AUTH_AUTHENTICATE

	* core: joined "invkey" and "nocookie" checks

	* global: phpss_login() and phpss_check() now return strings. these
	should not be compared using constants, but rather the strings
	themselves. this is in order to let modules return codes without having
	to register the constant in the core system first.

	* core: added PHPSS_MODULE_TOOL as a module type

	* core, tools/dbclean: removed all database cleanup infrastructure
	from the core system, and placed it in the dbclean tool. this means
	that database cleanups can only be performed by using the tool.

	* core: normal modules can no longer register any handlers, init
	handlers should be registered as hooks for the "system_init" event

	* ipaccess: removed the checktime option, checks are always done on
	both login and session validation

	* core: phpss_login() now destroys any session cookie which may be

	locks and fails
