Full installation instructions are available in the main documentation,
located under the docs/ directory.

These are very brief installation instructions:

- copy the phpsecuresite directory to somewhere *outside* your web-tree,
  for example /opt/phpsecuresite

- import the database structure for your database server type
  from the correct file under the database/ directory

- configure the system by editing the files under phpss/config/
